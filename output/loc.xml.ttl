  <https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#descriptiveNote> "An illustrated sheet music cover for a polka composed by Henry Bellman. Within a circular, ornamental border is an allegorical scene based on the seal of the State of Virginia.  A helmeted female figure armed with a spear and sword (probably Minerva) stands on the figure of a fallen despot.  The latter's crown and broken scepter appear near him on the ground. The scene is also littered with broken manacles and a cross." .
